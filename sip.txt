Since Talikala is our group's primary focus, we have desired objectives to tackle their issues, 
particularly the lack of funding that contributes to the lack of resources in their organization. 
Being a non-profit, Talikala largely depends on its sponsors and supporters to keep afloat, particularly 
in this pandemic period. Our group focuses on the project of planting tomato plants with the use of 2 
different types of compost which serves the goal of helping with food production and scarcity, therefore, 
improving the living conditions of the Talikala residents. This is because, with the improvement of the growth 
of the plants, the Talikala residents are able to have ample and good quality food resources while not having 
to worry so much about their food, therefore use their money for other resources such as education and clothes.
 Composting also allows the residents to have a sustainable food source as planting can lead to fruit which 
 can then be consumed as food, can be used for compost, and/or can be used for their seeds. Lastly, with Talikala
 being a safe haven for women who have gone through sexual abuse, composting not only brightens up their living 
 spaces, but it also gives the residents a purpose by allowing Talikala to help contribute to their environment.</p>

Compost is a combination of organic materials that can improve the growth rate of various plants when added to soil, 
giving it the nickname “Black Gold”. You can make proper compost if you include organic materials like food waste, excrement, 
and many more due to these materials having the ability to decompose easier and can be processed easier by multiple species and bacteria.
 Our group chose to focus on the Tomato plant and how compost can affect its growth rate based on the different nutrients
 different composts can give and how these composts can help increase the growth rate of the plant because of it having 
 the required nutrients and maybe more nutrients needed for an improved growth rate of tomatoes. We chose to study which 
 organic fertilizer is better for the tomato plants which were banana peels and eggshells. Both these organic alternatives 
 give an array of nutrients that can help the growth of tomatoes but also give their unique nutrients as well as being a viable 
 alternative due to the large number of eggshells and banana peels you can pile up in your day-to-day life. For example, Banana peels 
 have potassium in them which helps the overall ionic balance of the formation of the tomatoes, not only that but the lack of nitrogen 
 in tomatoes as well helps in the overall yield of the plants as well as their quality as well. However, eggshells provide calcium which 
 gives the tomatoes, Calcium that is not only used for triggering enzyme and cellular activity but also helps with cell wall strengthening 
 and development, therefore aiding in the growth of different parts of the Tomato like the stem. Not only that but it also helps in stabilizing 
 the acidity of the soil in order to make it habitable to the Tomatoes and prevents the acidity of the soil to stunt the growth of the Tomato 
 because of the nutrient deficiencies the acidity causes. All in all these two alternatives for fertilizer are the best because they provide a 
 wide array of important nutrients As defined by MasterClass (2021), eggshell compost delivers calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and potassium. 
 In addition, Conserve Energy Future (2022) underlines that banana peel compost offers magnesium, calcium, phosphates, potassium, sodium, sulfur, 
 and potassium. Both these composts with their nutrients help in soil stabilization, functionality, and soil structure to a certain degree and help 
 the structure of the Tomato plants through the use of the different nutrients that they both provide for example eggshells have calcium and no potassium 
 and vice versa for the banana peels. While these are the benefits of the fertilizers on Tomatoes we can’t forget the other benefits these alternatives 
 give like less waste, easy accessibility, can be applied in plants in a quick and easy-to-understand manner, and finally, the ability for them to spawn
 helpful bacteria and/or fungi. One last important piece of data is the application of these alternatives because when applied wrong it can greatly hinder 
 the plant instead of aiding it, the application of banana peels in order for them to decompose properly is that the peels must be aerated and then cut in 
 small pieces in order for them to decompose in an orderly fashion. The eggshells on the other hand must be dried in the sun in order for the salmonella to
 be killed.  In summary, our project is to determine which organic fertilizer is a better alternative to store-bought fertilizer and we suspect that banana
 peels are a better pick than eggshells, although we suspect this we cannot downplay the wide variety of positive effects and benefits that these two alternatives
 provide like how they help protect the plant from different ailments, allow the plants to reach their full potential, give the plant the required nutrients, 
 and even more benefits, they also help with more aspects like soil and how they can loosen its structure fit for the tomatoes and fixes its density and adjusts
 it in order for it to be the right environment for the plant to fully grow. And finally, while we suspect the banana peel is a better alternative this doesn’t mean
 it is the only option available for usage and not the eggshells because this project is a means to spread awareness about our environment and help waste management
 together with the lessons we can learn on how we can use organic waste like these in a better way.
